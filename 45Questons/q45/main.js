// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
var store_car = function (manufacturer, model, color, variant) {
    var car = {
        "manufacturer": manufacturer,
        "model": model,
        "color": color,
        "variant": variant
    };
    return car;
};
var car1 = store_car("Honda", "city", "silver");
console.log(car1.manufacturer, car1.model, car1.color);
